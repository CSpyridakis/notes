### 1. Partitioning

| Feature                | ZFS                                                                                     | UFS                                                                                       |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|                        | Zettabyte File System.                                                                  | Unix File System. 
|                        | **Prefered**                                                                            | **Not prefered** 
| **Architecture**       | Pooled storage with an integrated volume manager                                        | Traditional file system operating on fixed disk partitions                                |
| **Data Integrity**     | End-to-end checksumming and self-healing capabilities                                   | Limited data integrity features; relies on lower-level RAID or manual checksumming          |
| **Snapshots & Clones** | Built-in, efficient snapshots and cloning support                                       | Some variants (like UFS2 on FreeBSD) offer snapshot support but less integrated overall     |
| **Scalability**        | Designed for large-scale storage environments and high scalability                        | Suited for simpler, smaller storage systems                                                 |
| **RAID Integration**   | Integrated RAID support (e.g., RAID-Z)                                                    | Does not include integrated RAID; external RAID solutions are typically used                |
| **Performance**        | Advanced features may add overhead; performance can vary with workload and configuration   | Generally simpler and may offer lower overhead in less complex environments                 |
| **Additional Features**| Supports built-in compression, deduplication, and dynamic striping                         | Fewer built-in features; additional functionality typically requires separate solutions      |
| **Licensing**          | Open source under the CDDL license                                                      | Often used under BSD licenses (in FreeBSD) or proprietary in some other implementations       |

## Single NIC

If you want to install pfSense on a x86 machine with a single NIC, you can still use it, as long as you also use a managed switch with VLANs support. Then, you will be able to use one VLAN as WAN and another as LAN, connect a single Ethernet cable to the x86 machine and still work.

### Procedure
1. Install pfSense on the desired device
2. Reboot device
3. Setup VLANs during first boot
   1. Select as parent interface the available NIC and create a new VLAN
   2. Provide a tag for this VLAN (e.g. 10)
   3. Continue with the configuration
   4. Give for WAN the {interface}.VID 
   5. Give for LAN the {interface}
