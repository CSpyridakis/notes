# GitOps

## FluxCD vs ArgoCD
### **Overview**

| Feature              | **FluxCD**                            | **ArgoCD**                         |
|----------------------|----------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| **Primary Use Case** | Continuous deployment for Kubernetes. | Application-focused GitOps for Kubernetes. |
| **Architecture**     | Agent-based, Git-pull model.          | Web-based UI and API, Git-pull model. |
| **GitOps Model**     | Pushes changes automatically to Kubernetes clusters. | Monitors Git and syncs changes upon request or automatically. |
| **Popularity**       | Ideal for CI/CD pipelines and cluster-wide automation. | Widely used for application lifecycle management. |

### **Key Differences**

| Aspect                     | **FluxCD**                                      | **ArgoCD**                                     |
|----------------------------|------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| **Installation**            | Lightweight; fewer dependencies.               | Slightly heavier; includes a UI and API server. |
| **Declarative Support**     | Full support for Kubernetes manifests and Helm charts. | Similar support but focused on application-level resources. |
| **User Interface**          | CLI-driven and YAML-based configuration.       | Rich Web UI for visualization and management. |
| **Multi-Cluster Support**   | Supports multi-cluster, but requires Flux instances in each cluster. | Native multi-cluster management.             |
| **Sync Mechanism**          | Automatically applies changes from Git.        | Can be automated or manual with sync buttons in the UI. |
| **Drift Detection**         | Detects drift but does not notify; reconciles automatically. | Detects drift and can notify users via UI or webhook. |
| **Custom Resources**        | Focused on Kubernetes native resources.        | Supports additional resource types like CRDs. |
| **Scalability**             | Excellent for managing infrastructure at scale. | Better for managing applications in complex environments. |
| **Notifications**           | Requires additional setup (e.g., webhooks).    | Built-in notification support for drift and sync events. |
