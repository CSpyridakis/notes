## > Migration

### VM Migration
VMs can be **live migrated** between nodes (e.g., Node A â†’ Node B) without downtime, thanks to Proxmox's built-in HA (High Availability) support.

### Container Migration
Container (CT) migration requires the container to be shut down. **Live migration** is not supported for containers.
