# Notes

## 🗒️ General Notes
This repository contains a personal collection of notes and scripts, collected over the years, regarding different technologies and tools.

## 💡 Purpose
The idea is to solve each problem once and minimize the time spent, or automate the process, of resolving the same problem in the future.

## 💬 What should I expect?
Documentation about different technologies. For example, notes regarding different programming languages, such as [Rust](./Rust/), are available. There are also notes related to [Linux](./Linux/), [Debian](./Debian/), and even [SSH](./SSH/).

Navigate to the different directories or search for keywords to find solutions or guidance on a given task.

## ❓ After that?
If you have any further questions or need help with another topic, feel free to create a pull request.
