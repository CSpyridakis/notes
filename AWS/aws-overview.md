## AWS

### Regions
A Region is a physical location around the world where AWS clusters its data centers.

e.g., `us-east-1a`, `us-east-1b`, `us-east-1c`

**Use Cases:**
- Deploying applications closer to end-users to reduce latency.
- Meeting regulatory and compliance requirements for data locality.
- Setting up disaster recovery strategies with multi-region backups.

### Availability zones
An Availability Zone is one or more discrete data centers within a Region. Each AZ has independent power, cooling, and networking but is connected to other AZs in the same Region through low-latency links.

**Use Cases:**
- High availability architectures by distributing applications across multiple AZs.
- Fault tolerance by replicating data in multiple AZs.
- Running critical workloads without a single point of failure.

### **1. Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)**
Provides virtualized computing resources over the internet. This includes servers, storage, and networking.

**Examples:**
1. **Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud):**  
Provides virtual servers to run applications.  

2. **Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service):**  
Scalable object storage for backup, data archiving, and big data analytics.  

3. **Amazon VPC (Virtual Private Cloud):**  
Allows you to define and control a virtual network isolated from other AWS customers.

### **2. Platform as a Service (PaaS)**
Provides a managed platform for developing, running, and managing applications without dealing with the underlying infrastructure. 

**Examples:**
1. **AWS Elastic Beanstalk:**  
Automatically handles deployment, scaling, and monitoring of web applications.  

2. **AWS Lambda:**  
Serverless compute service where you run code in response to events.  

3. **AWS RDS (Relational Database Service):**  
Managed database service for relational databases.  

---

### **3. Software as a Service (SaaS)**
Provides complete software applications that run on cloud infrastructure.

**Examples:**
1. **Amazon WorkSpaces:**  
A managed, secure cloud desktop solution.  

2. **Amazon Chime:**  
A communication service for video conferencing, chat, and screen sharing.  

3. **Amazon QuickSight:**  
A business intelligence service to create interactive dashboards and visualizations.
