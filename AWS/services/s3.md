# Simple Storage Service (S3)

Is a global storage service that can be accessed over the internet. Can be used to store and retrieve **any amount** ("infinitely scaling") of data, from anywhere.

It automatically handles backups (stores data across multiple facilities)

Data are stored as `objects` within `buckets`, and the name of each bucket must be unique.

Properties exist on both levels (`objects` & `buckets`) so permissions can be set.

In conjunction with [EFS](./efs.md) we do not need to mount a file system. We can programmatically access the data, even though it is possible to mount to a drive.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> To find differences between [EBS](./ebs.md), [EFS](./efs.md), [Instance store](./ec2.md#5-ec2-instance-store) and [S3](./s3.md) read [this](./ebs-vs-efs-vs-instance-store-vs-s3.md).
> Other storing services: [Amazon FSx](./fsx.md).

> **Note**
> Useful info:
> 
> **Bucket** is actually a kind of directory
> **Object** is the file that is stored
> **Bucket name** must be unique across all regions
> **Buckets** are defined at a region level but are accessable globally

## Common Use Case

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    A[EC2] <--> F[Bucket]
    B[EC2] <--> F
    F <--> C[EC2]
    F <--> D[EC2]
    
    style A fill:#0066CC
    style B fill:#0066CC
    style C fill:#0066CC
    style D fill:#0066CC
    
```

## Objects
Objects have **keys**, which is the **FULL** path of the file. There are **NOT** actually directories, even though the key seems to contain them.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    TL(["<b>Key contents:</b>"]):::titleStyle
    classDef titleStyle fill:none,stroke:none,font-size:16px,text-align:left;

    s3["s3://"]
    style s3 opacity:0,height:1,width:0.01,color:#f00

    bucket-name["bucket-name/"]
    style bucket-name opacity:0,height:1,width:30,color:#6d7

    prefix["folder1/folder2/"]
    style prefix opacity:0,height:1,width:75,color:#fc7e51

    object["file_name.txt"]
    style object opacity:0,height:1,width:25,color:#5eb9ff

    expl-prefix["\* Prefix"]
    style expl-prefix opacity:0,height:1,width:75,color:#fc7e51

    expl-obj["\* Object name"]
    style expl-obj opacity:0,height:1,width:25,color:#5eb9ff
```

> [!WARNING]
> Limitations:
>
> * For files > 5Gb use `multi-part upload`
> * Object size must be <= 5TB

Each object can also have **metadata** and **tags**.
