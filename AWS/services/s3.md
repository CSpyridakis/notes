# Simple Storage Service (S3)

Is a global storage service that can be accessed over the internet. Can be used to store and retrieve any amount of data, from anywhere.

It automatically handles backups (stores data across multiple facilities)

Data are stored as `objects` within `buckets`, and the name of each bucket must be unique.

Properties exist on both levels (`objects` & `buckets`) so permissions can be set.

In conjunction with [EFS](./efs.md) we do not need to mount a file system. We can programmatically access the data, even though it is possible to mount to a drive.
