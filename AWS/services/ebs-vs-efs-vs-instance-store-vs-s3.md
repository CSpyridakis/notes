| Feature                | EFS (Elastic File System)                     | EBS (Elastic Block Store)                 | EC2 Instance Store                               | S3 (Simple Storage Service)                  |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| **Type**               | Network File System                          | Block Storage                             | Ephemeral Local Storage                     | Object Storage                                |
| **Access**             | Shared by multiple EC2 instances concurrently | Dedicated to a single EC2 instance        | Attached to a single EC2 instance           | Accessible via APIs globally                 |
| **Persistence**        | Persistent                                   | Persistent                                | Non-persistent; data lost on instance stop  | Persistent                                   |
| **Use Case**           | Shared file system, scalable workloads       | Persistent storage for one instance       | Temporary storage, high-speed applications  | Backups, archives, static files, big data, Hybrid Cloud storage, Applications hosting, Media hosting    |
| **Performance**        | Scalable (General Purpose or Max I/O modes)  | High performance (gp3, io1, io2 for IOPS) | Very high IOPS, low latency                 | Scales massively, slightly higher latency    |
| **Data Durability**    | Stored redundantly across AZs                | Stored redundantly within one AZ          | No durability; tied to the lifecycle of the instance | 99.999999999% durability (11 nines)          |
| **Scalability**        | Automatic scaling (GB to PB)                 | Pre-provisioned; scale manually           | Fixed to the instance type                  | Unlimited, auto-scales                       |
| **Protocol**           | NFS (Network File System)                    | Block-level storage                       | Block-level storage                         | REST APIs (HTTP, HTTPS)                      |
| **Availability**       | Multi-AZ                                     | Single AZ (can use snapshots for backups) | Tied to instance                            | Global (cross-region options available)      |
| **Pricing Model**      | Pay-per-use (GB/month, IA tier for cost-saving) | Pay for provisioned capacity (GB/month)  | Included in the instance cost               | Pay-per-use (per GB stored and accessed)     |
| **Best For**           | Shared storage, web servers, machine learning | Databases, transaction-heavy apps         | Caching, temporary storage, NoSQL databases | Backups, static websites, big data analytics |
| **Examples**           | Media workflows, shared dev environments     | Running relational DBs, data warehousing  | High-speed caching, buffer for big data     | Data lakes, log storage, media hosting       |
| **Encryption**         | Supports encryption at rest and in transit (via KMS) | Supports encryption at rest (via KMS)    | No default encryption; application-level security | Supports encryption at rest (via KMS)        |
| **Backup**             | Integrated with AWS Backup for automated backups | Snapshots provide incremental backups, stored in S3 | No backup support; ephemeral data storage | Versioning and lifecycle policies            |
| **Shared Access**      | Multiple instances can access simultaneously  | Single instance access, multi-attach for io2 | Single instance only                        | Accessible by multiple clients globally      |
| **Latency**            | Slightly higher latency compared to EBS due to network access | Low latency due to direct attachment       | Very low latency, directly attached         | Higher latency, designed for non-real-time   |
| **Limitations for AMIs (OS Type)** | - Supports most Linux-based OS.<br>- Not directly supported for Windows without third-party NFS software. | - Supports all OS types.<br>- Can be used as root volume for EC2 instances. | - Typically used with Linux-based AMIs.<br>- Not suitable for Windows persistence. | - Cannot be used as root volume or directly mounted.<br>- Used via APIs, not OS-level. |
| **Other Important Info** | - Ideal for shared workloads and data accessible from multiple instances.<br>- Pricing depends on storage class (Standard vs. IA). | - Common choice for EC2 instances needing persistent storage.<br>- io1/io2 allow for provisioned IOPS. | - Best for temporary data and high-speed caching.<br>- Tied to instance lifecycle. | - Ideal for object storage, with cost-efficient tiers like Glacier for archival. |
