# Serverless
Serverless is a **cloud computing model** where the **cloud provider** automatically **manages** the infrastructure, allowing developers to focus solely on writing code without worrying about provisioning, managing, or scaling servers.

**AWS serverless services examples:**
1. [S3](../services/s3.md)
2. [DynamoDB](../services/dynamodb.md)
3. [Fargate](../services/ecs.md#elastic-container-service-ecs)
4. [Lambda](../services/lambda.md)


**Benefits:**
- **Simplified Development:** No need to manage infrastructure, which accelerates development.
- **Cost-Effective:** You only pay for what you use, making it more cost-efficient for applications with variable traffic.
- **Faster Time to Market:** With less infrastructure to manage, applications can be developed and deployed faster.
