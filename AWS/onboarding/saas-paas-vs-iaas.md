# AWS PaaS/SaaS vs Traditional IaaS
Comparison between native AWS services (PaaS/SaaS) and traditional implementations (IaaS) in terms of features, advantages, and trade-offs.

## General Comparison

| Category              | Native AWS Services (PaaS/SaaS)                                      | Traditional Implementation (IaaS)                                             |
|-----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Compute               | **Elastic Beanstalk**: Abstracts server management, scaling, and deployment of applications. | **EC2 Instances**: Requires manual setup of servers, OS, and app environment.    |
| Load Balancing        | **Elastic Load Balancer (ELB)**: Fully managed, auto-scaling, and integrated with AWS. | **Custom LB on EC2**: Requires manual configuration and maintenance.              |
| Database              | **RDS**: Fully managed relational databases (MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc.).  | **MySQL on EC2**: Requires setting up, patching, and managing database servers.   |
| File Storage          | **EFS**: Managed, scalable network file storage for EC2 instances.      | **NFS on EC2**: Requires setup, scaling, and ensuring high availability manually.  |
| Scaling               | Auto Scaling Groups: Automatically adjusts capacity based on demand. | **Custom Scaling Scripts**: Requires manual monitoring and scaling logic.         |
| Monitoring            | **CloudWatch**: Built-in metrics, alarms, and dashboards.               | **Custom Monitoring**: Requires third-party tools or setting up custom solutions. |
| Backup/Recovery       | Built-in snapshots (e.g., for RDS, EBS).                             | Manual backups (or scripts) for EC2 instances and attached volumes.           |
| Security              | **IAM, Security Groups, WAF**: Fine-grained security controls and managed updates. | Custom security configurations on EC2 instances and other infrastructure.     |
| Ease of Use           | High: Minimal configuration; AWS manages infrastructure.            | Low: Requires significant manual intervention and expertise.                  |
| Customization         | Moderate: Limited control over underlying infrastructure.           | High: Full control of software and infrastructure setup.                      |
| Cost                  | Pay-per-use for managed services; optimized for time-to-market.     | Typically lower if managed well but incurs hidden operational and management costs. |
| Scalability           | Seamless auto-scaling built into services like ELB, RDS, and Beanstalk. | Needs custom scripts or manual scaling setup.                                 |
