Comparison between native AWS services ([PaaS/SaaS](./aws-overview.md#service-types)) and traditional implementations ([IaaS](./aws-overview.md#service-types)) in terms of features, advantages, and trade-offs.

## General Comparison

| Category              | Native AWS Services ([PaaS/SaaS](./aws-overview.md#service-types))                                      | Traditional Implementation ([IaaS](./aws-overview.md#service-types))                                             |
|-----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Compute               | **Elastic Beanstalk**: Abstracts server management, scaling, and deployment of applications. | **[EC2](../services/ec2.md) Instances**: Requires manual setup of servers, OS, and app environment.    |
| Load Balancing        | [Elastic Load Balancer (ELB)](../services/elb.md): Fully managed, auto-scaling, and integrated with AWS. | **Custom LB on [EC2](../services/ec2.md)**: Requires manual configuration and maintenance.              |
| Database              | **[RDS](../services/rds.md)**: Fully managed relational databases (MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc.).  | **MySQL on [EC2](../services/ec2.md)**: Requires setting up, patching, and managing database servers.   |
| File Storage          | **[EFS](../services/efs.md)**: Managed, scalable network file storage for [EC2](../services/ec2.md) instances.      | **NFS on [EC2](../services/ec2.md)**: Requires setup, scaling, and ensuring high availability manually.  |
| Scaling               | Auto Scaling Groups: Automatically adjusts capacity based on demand. | **Custom Scaling Scripts**: Requires manual monitoring and scaling logic.         |
| Monitoring            | **CloudWatch**: Built-in metrics, alarms, and dashboards.               | **Custom Monitoring**: Requires third-party tools or setting up custom solutions. |
| Backup/Recovery       | Built-in snapshots (e.g., for [RDS](../services/rds.md), [EBS](../services/ebs.md)).                             | Manual backups (or scripts) for [EC2](../services/ec2.md) instances and attached volumes.           |
| Security              | **IAM, Security Groups, WAF**: Fine-grained security controls and managed updates. | Custom security configurations on [EC2](../services/ec2.md)    instances and other infrastructure.     |
| Ease of Use           | High: Minimal configuration; AWS manages infrastructure.            | Low: Requires significant manual intervention and expertise.                  |
| Customization         | Moderate: Limited control over underlying infrastructure.           | High: Full control of software and infrastructure setup.                      |
| Cost                  | Pay-per-use for managed services; optimized for time-to-market.     | Typically lower if managed well but incurs hidden operational and management costs. |
| Scalability           | Seamless auto-scaling built into services like [ELB](../services/elb.md), [RDS](../services/rds.md), and Beanstalk. | Needs custom scripts or manual scaling setup.                                 |
