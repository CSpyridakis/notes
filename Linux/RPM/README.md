## Package manager
Both `yum` and `dnf` are package management tools used on RPM-based Linux distributions (like Fedora, CentOS, and Red Hat), but they differ in design, performance, and features. 

- `yum` (Yellowdog Updater Modified):
    - Developed as a front-end to RPM, yum has been the traditional package manager for many RPM-based systems. It simplified dependency management compared to the raw RPM tool.
    - Remains available on some distributions for legacy support.

- `dnf` (Dandified Yum):
    - Introduced as the next-generation version of yum, dnf was created to address limitations in yum. Itâ€™s now the default package manager in many newer Fedora and Red Hat systems.
    - Aims to be largely compatible with yum command syntax to ease the transition, but there may be subtle differences in behavior or available options.
