# Multipass
**Multipass** is a lightweight VM manager developed by Canonical, designed to quickly launch and manage Ubuntu VMs on your local machine.

Itâ€™s like a super-simplified alternative to tools like **VirtualBox**, **Docker**, or **Vagrant**, but specifically for Ubuntu and Ubuntu images.

sudo snap install multipass

## Known issues
```
ERROR: ld.so: object 'libgtk3-nocsd.so.0' from LD_PRELOAD cannot be preloaded (failed to map segment from shared object): ignored.
